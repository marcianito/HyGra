Authors@R: person("Marvin", "Reich", email = "mreich@posteo.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides some basic functions useful for setting up, working on and processing data from HYDRO-GRAVIMETRIC projecs.
             For specific use cases, additional (project and topic) related R-packages are availlable (e.g. UmbrellaEffect, gravityInf, gravitySynth, etc.).
             This package therefore provides the basis for hydrogravitational data analysis (both pre- and post-processing).
