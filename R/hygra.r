#' Hydrology and gravimetry
#'
#' This package contains varies functions all around hydro-gravitational modeling and data pre-and post-processing.
#' Some of them are still very limited to special input-classes while others are written in a more general way.
#' This is a package I used myself for carrying on modeling and data-handling so some things might not be interesting for everyone
#' but I think it will give everyone interested in this topic a good start and some functions & data to start experimenting
#'
#' Main procedures of this package are:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item DEMs
#' \item read observed datasets
#' \item read model output datasets
#' \item create gravitational component arrays (3D,2D,1D), corresponding to each setup (model)
#' \item calculate gravity response of model output
#' \item visualize data (observed, calculated, model results)
#' \item ...
#' }
