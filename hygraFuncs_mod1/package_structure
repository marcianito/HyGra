######################################

##dependencies of other packages:
# zoo, reshape2, dplyr, ggplot2, dplyrExtras, grid, gridExtra, scales, plyr, HydroMe, xts, 
#

##gravity-internal.r :
# functions for internal usage, no real passing / modifying of parameters; so far only gravity calculations (forsberg, macmillan, point-mass)

##functions : 
# perform a in itself logical and closed calculation, transformation or just plotting

##scritps :
# a logical and "cronological" combination of various functions and in between calculations; in the best case they combine all calculations needed for one location or research question

## locations, purposes / research questions, so far:

##comparewettzell.r
# calculate timeshifts of different time series (soil moisture, groundwater)
# calculate hydrological vadose zone parameters (Ksat, Kun, eff.Porosity, saturation, vanGenuchten parameters, theta X at saturation Y (and viceversa) 

##trime.r
# calculate and plot 3-directional vertical trime measurements

##allhydrus.r
# everything needed for hydrus modeling (1D,2D,3D)
# create DEM for hydrus
# generate input time series
# plotting hydrus output

##wettzell_ConcepHydMod.r
# conceptional hydrological model (different storage compartments)
# modified and translated into r from Benjamin Creutzfelds storage department model
# calculate gravity response (local hydrology only), based on DEM for hyd-mod domain and compartments
# generate input time series for wettzell
# parameter selection or monte carlo simulation
# calculate storages snow, snowmelt, infiltration into soil, first soil storage, saprolite, groundwater
# water storage changes (WSC) of storage compartments and their plotting

##preparedatawettzell.r
# prepare time series for wettzell (soil moisture, climate data, groundwater levels, lysimeter data, runoff, snow, precipitation)
# filter data for read-error-corrections

##wettzell_Hydrus.r
# calculate gravity response (local hydrology), based on DEM for hydrus domain and compartments
# read hydrus output
# plot soil moisture and groundwater

##wettzell.r
#! seems old and meanwhile split into several other files !#
#!? not sure, check !?#
