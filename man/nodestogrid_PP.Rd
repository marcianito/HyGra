\title{Interpolate 2D / 3D nodes of a time series to regular grid using parralel computing}
\usage{
nodestogrid_PP(data_input, grid_discr, depth_split, grid_new = NA,
  nintpmax = 10, dimension = "d2")
}
\arguments{
\item{data_input}{data to be interpolated. this has to be a data.frame with columns (x, y, z, value).}

\item{grid_discr}{vector of discretization of new grid in (x,y,z).}

\item{grid_depth}{vector of vertical extents of new grid in c(min,max).}

\item{grid_cords}{grid to be interpolated to. if no grid is passed, it is created from input_data spatial ranges.}

\item{nintmax}{maximal number of points to consider in the surroundings for one interpolation point}
}
\description{
